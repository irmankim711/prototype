# 🚀 AI Reporting Platform - 7-Day MVP Sprint Plan

**Senior DevOps Engineer**: Meta-Level Implementation Strategy  
**Timeline**: 7 Days to MVP Readiness  
**Tech Stack**: Flask + PostgreSQL + Celery/Redis + React 18 + TypeScript  
**Target**: Production-ready deployment with 80% test coverage

## 📊 Current System Assessment

### ✅ **Already Implemented**

- Flask backend with PostgreSQL + Redis architecture

2. **Form Builder**: Missing conditional logic, live preview, advanced drag & drop
3. **API Integrations**: Google Sheets + Microsoft Word integrations incomplete
4. **Testing**: Current coverage < 30%, need 80% target
5. **Deployment**: Missing Railway/Render deployment pipeline
6. **CI/CD**: Missing automated QA checks and pre-deploy validation
7. **AI Integration**: OpenAI API with fallback agents not implemented
8. **Report Generation**: LaTeX + Docx + PDF export needs completion

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation Strategies

### **High-Risk Areas**

1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and request batching
2. **Database Performance**: Add connection pooling and query optimization
3. **Memory Usage**: Configure Celery worker memory limits
4. **Third-party Dependencies**: Add circuit breakers and fallbacks

### **Contingency Plans**

- **Day 1-2 Delays**: Prioritize core Celery functionality over advanced features
- **Day 3-4 Delays**: Focus on Google Sheets over Microsoft Word integration
- **Day 5-6 Delays**: Deploy to simpler platform (Heroku) as backup
- **Day 7 Delays**: Use simple OpenAI integration without fallback agents
