# External Forms in Form Status Management - Test Summary

## ðŸš€ **Enhancement Implemented**

Successfully integrated external forms from FormBuilderAdmin into the Form Status Management tab.

### âœ… **Changes Made:**

   - Added `externalForms={externalForms}` prop to FormStatusManager component

2. **FormStatusManager.tsx:**
   - Added `ExternalForm` interface to match FormBuilderAdmin
   - Updated `FormStatusManagerProps` to accept `externalForms` prop
   - Created `ExtendedForm` type to handle both backend and external forms
   - Modified `fetchForms()` to combine backend and external forms
   - Updated all helper functions to work with `ExtendedForm`
   - Added conditional rendering for external forms:
     - No toggle switches (can't change status of external forms)
     - Shows external URL instead of submission count
     - "External" status chip in blue
     - "Open External Form" button that opens the actual URL
   - Enhanced details dialog to show external form information
