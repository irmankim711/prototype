# Environment Variable Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing a "process is not defined" error because it was trying to use `process.env` in a Vite-based React application. In Vite, you must use `import.meta.env` instead of `process.env`.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `environment.ts`
- Changed all `process.env` references to `import.meta.env`
- Updated all environment variable names from `REACT_APP_` prefix to `VITE_` prefix
- This is required because Vite only exposes environment variables with the `VITE_` prefix to the client

### 2. Updated `ProductionAPIService.ts`
- Changed `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` to `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`

### 3. Updated `ApiServiceExample.tsx`
- Changed `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `import.meta.env.MODE`

### 4. Updated Environment Files
- Updated `env.development` to use `VITE_` prefix
- Updated `env.production.template` to use `VITE_` prefix
- Updated documentation in `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_README.md`

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Create a `.env` file
Create a `.env` file in your `frontend` directory with the following content:

```bash
# Development Environment Configuration
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_API_TIMEOUT=30000
VITE_MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
VITE_RETRY_DELAY=1000
VITE_MAX_RETRY_DELAY=10000

# OAuth Configuration
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id-dev.apps.googleusercontent.com
VITE_MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=your-microsoft-client-id-dev

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_AI_FEATURES=true
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
VITE_ENABLE_PWA=false
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=true

# Application Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=Automated Report Platform
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development

# Development Tools
VITE_ENABLE_HOT_RELOAD=true
VITE_ENABLE_SOURCE_MAPS=true
VITE_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=false

# Security
VITE_ENABLE_HTTPS_ONLY=false
VITE_ENABLE_CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY=false
VITE_ENABLE_HSTS=false
```

### 2. Update Your Environment Variables
- Replace placeholder values (like `your-google-client-id-dev`) with your actual credentials
- Make sure `VITE_API_URL` points to your backend server
- Set `VITE_ENVIRONMENT` to `development` for local development

### 3. Restart Your Development Server
After creating the `.env` file, restart your Vite development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Why This Happened

- **Create React App** uses `REACT_APP_` prefix and `process.env`
- **Vite** uses `VITE_` prefix and `import.meta.env`
- Your project was migrated from Create React App to Vite, but the environment configuration wasn't updated

## Important Notes

1. **VITE_ Prefix Required**: Only environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the client in Vite
2. **Security**: Never commit `.env` files with real credentials to version control
3. **Build Process**: Vite will replace `import.meta.env.VITE_*` with actual values during build time

## Verification

After making these changes, you should:
1. No longer see "process is not defined" errors
2. Be able to access environment variables through `import.meta.env.VITE_*`
3. Have your application work correctly with the environment configuration

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:
1. Make sure you've restarted the development server
2. Verify the `.env` file is in the correct location (`frontend/.env`)
3. Check that all required environment variables are set
4. Look for any remaining `process.env` references in your code
