# Comprehensive Health Check and Monitoring System

This document outlines the comprehensive health check and monitoring system implemented for the application, including system status monitoring, performance metrics, and graceful shutdown handling.

## üè• Health Check System

### Overview
The health check system provides comprehensive monitoring of:
- **Database connectivity** and performance
- **Redis connectivity** and performance  
- **External API connectivity** (Google, Microsoft, OpenAI)
- **System resources** (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Application status** and responsiveness

### Health Check Endpoints

#### 1. `/health` - Comprehensive Health Check
```bash
GET /health
```
Returns detailed system status including:
- Overall system health (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
- Individual service status
- Performance metrics
- Timestamps and correlation IDs

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "System status: healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "summary": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "total_checks": 5,
    "healthy_checks": 5,
    "degraded_checks": 0,
    "unhealthy_checks": 0
  },
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "database",
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Database connection healthy",
      "details": {
        "query_duration_ms": 45.2,
        "connection_pool_size": 10
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. `/health/simple` - Simple Health Check
```bash
GET /health/simple
```
Lightweight endpoint for load balancers and basic health monitoring.

#### 3. `/health/ready` - Readiness Probe
```bash
GET /health/ready
```
Kubernetes readiness probe endpoint. Checks if the application is ready to receive traffic.

#### 4. `/health/live` - Liveness Probe
```bash
GET /health/live
```
Kubernetes liveness probe endpoint. Verifies the application is alive and responding.

#### 5. `/health/performance` - Performance Metrics
```bash
GET /health/performance?hours=24
```
Returns performance metrics for the last N hours (requires authentication).

#### 6. `/health/check/<check_name>` - Specific Health Check
```bash
GET /health/check/database
GET /health/check/redis
GET /health/check/system_resources
```
Run a specific health check by name.

#### 7. `/health/refresh` - Force Refresh
```bash
POST /health/refresh
```
Force refresh of health check cache (requires authentication).

#### 8. `/health/status` - Current Status
```bash
GET /health/status
```
Get current health status without running checks.

## üìä Metrics and Monitoring

### Prometheus Integration
The system provides a `/metrics` endpoint that exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics:

- **HTTP Metrics**: Request count, duration, size, active requests
- **Database Metrics**: Query count, duration, connection count
- **Redis Metrics**: Operation count, duration, connection count
- **Business Metrics**: User logins, form submissions, report generations

### Performance Monitoring
The `PerformanceMonitor` class tracks:
- Request performance metrics
- Database query performance
- Redis operation performance
- External API call performance
- System resource usage

### Structured Logging
All health checks and monitoring events use structured logging with:
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Request context (user ID, IP address, user agent)
- Performance metrics
- Error details and stack traces

## üîß Configuration

### Health Check Configuration
```python
# Register health checks
from app.core.health_checks import (
    HealthCheckRegistry,
    DatabaseHealthCheck,
    RedisHealthCheck,
    ExternalAPIHealthCheck,
    SystemResourceHealthCheck
)

registry = HealthCheckRegistry()

# Database health check
db_check = DatabaseHealthCheck(db_session)
registry.register_check(db_check)

# Redis health check
redis_check = RedisHealthCheck(redis_client)
registry.register_check(redis_check)

# External API checks
google_check = ExternalAPIHealthCheck("google", "https://www.google.com")
microsoft_check = ExternalAPIHealthCheck("microsoft", "https://www.microsoft.com")
openai_check = ExternalAPIHealthCheck("openai", "https://api.openai.com")

registry.register_check(google_check)
registry.register_check(microsoft_check)
registry.register_check(openai_check)

# System resources check
system_check = SystemResourceHealthCheck()
registry.register_check(system_check)
```

### Monitoring Configuration
```python
# Initialize monitoring
from app.core.monitoring import (
    CorrelationIDMiddleware,
    performance_monitor,
    structured_logger
)

# Add correlation ID middleware
correlation_middleware = CorrelationIDMiddleware(app)

# Use performance monitoring decorators
@monitor_performance(endpoint="user_creation", method="POST")
def create_user(user_data):
    # Function implementation
    pass

@monitor_database_queries(operation="insert", table="users")
def insert_user(user_data):
    # Database operation
    pass

@monitor_redis_operations(operation="set")
def cache_user_data(user_id, data):
    # Redis operation
    pass
```

## üö™ Graceful Shutdown

### Overview
The graceful shutdown system ensures proper cleanup of resources when the application is terminated.

### Features
- **Signal Handling**: SIGTERM and SIGINT handling
- **Priority-based Cleanup**: Ordered resource cleanup
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for cleanup operations
- **Critical Hook Management**: Critical vs. non-critical cleanup operations

### Usage
```python
from app.core.graceful_shutdown import (
    register_shutdown_hook,
    register_common_shutdown_hooks,
    is_shutting_down,
    require_running
)

# Register custom shutdown hooks
def cleanup_custom_resources():
    logger.info("Cleaning up custom resources...")
    # Cleanup logic

register_shutdown_hook(
    name="custom_cleanup",
    callback=cleanup_custom_resources,
    priority=3,
    timeout=15.0,
    critical=False
)

# Register common shutdown hooks
register_common_shutdown_hooks(app, db, redis_client, celery_app)

# Use shutdown-aware decorators
@require_running
def critical_operation():
    # This function won't run during shutdown
    pass

# Use shutdown-aware context manager
from app.core.graceful_shutdown import shutdown_aware_operation

with shutdown_aware_operation():
    # Operations that should not run during shutdown
    pass
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements-monitoring.txt
```

### 2. Initialize Health Checks
```python
# In your Flask app initialization
from app.core.health_checks import HealthCheckRegistry
from app.core.monitoring import CorrelationIDMiddleware

# Create health check registry
registry = HealthCheckRegistry()
app.health_check_registry = registry

# Register health checks
# ... (see configuration section)

# Add correlation ID middleware
correlation_middleware = CorrelationIDMiddleware(app)
```

### 3. Register Health Check Routes
```python
from app.routes.health import health_bp

app.register_blueprint(health_bp, url_prefix='/api')
```

### 4. Initialize Graceful Shutdown
```python
from app.core.graceful_shutdown import register_common_shutdown_hooks

# Register shutdown hooks
register_common_shutdown_hooks(app, db, redis_client, celery_app)
```

## üìà Monitoring Dashboard

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Health Checks Failing
- **Check Dependencies**: Ensure Redis and database are running
- **Verify Configuration**: Check connection strings and credentials
- **Review Logs**: Check application logs for detailed error messages

#### 2. Metrics Not Collecting
- **Verify Prometheus Client**: Ensure prometheus-client is installed
- **Check Endpoint**: Verify `/metrics` endpoint is accessible
- **Review Configuration**: Check monitoring configuration

#### 3. Graceful Shutdown Issues
- **Signal Handling**: Verify signal handlers are registered
- **Hook Priorities**: Check shutdown hook priorities
- **Timeout Issues**: Adjust timeout values for slow operations

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging for detailed monitoring information:
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('app.core.health_checks').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('app.core.monitoring').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## üß™ Testing

### Health Check Testing
```python
import pytest
from app.core.health_checks import HealthCheckRegistry

def test_health_check_registry():
    registry = HealthCheckRegistry()
    assert len(registry.checks) == 0
    
    # Add test checks
    # Run health checks
    # Verify results
```

### Performance Monitoring Testing
```python
def test_performance_monitoring():
    # Test performance monitoring decorators
    # Verify metrics collection
    # Check performance data
```
